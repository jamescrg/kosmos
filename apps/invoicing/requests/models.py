"""A payment request: an outgoing ask for a matter's full open balance.

Distinct from a Payment, which only exists once money moves. A request is created
(status SENT) when the firm emails a client a catch-up balance link; it flips to
PAID when that link is paid (see apps.invoicing.pay), recording the resulting
Payment. The signed pay-link token carries this row's ``uuid`` (never its pk).
